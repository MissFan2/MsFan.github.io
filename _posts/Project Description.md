### Project Description

### Idea
Nowadays, people’s lifestyles are influenced by globalization. People not only concern themselves with local news, but also focus on the international news. And specially, in some modules like politics and sports, it’s interesting to know the opinions from different countries. However, there may be a language problem for readers to get information from other opinions written in different languages. Our app will focus on this problem and provides multiple views for users.

### Use Cases
* When a controversial call happened during a football match between two clubs from England and Spain, what are the opinions on it of the fans of the two clubs?

* A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. A British may want to know how European or people in other countries think about it.
